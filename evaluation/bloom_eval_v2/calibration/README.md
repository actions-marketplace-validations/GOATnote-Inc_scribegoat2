# Physician Adjudication Pipeline

## What This Is

A 3-layer validation stack for calibrating the Bloom Eval v2 LLM-as-judge grader against expert clinical judgment:

1. **Layer 0: Pattern matching** -- deterministic keyword/regex classification
2. **Layer 1: LLM judge** -- cross-vendor LLM grading (GPT-5.2 judging Opus, Opus judging GPT)
3. **Layer 2: Physician adjudication** -- board-certified EM physician review with structured assessment

**Calibrator:** Brandon Dent, MD -- ABEM board-certified emergency physician, 11 years clinical experience, ~40,000 patient encounters

## Why This Exists

- **Judge calibration**: Quantify agreement between LLM grader and physician (Cohen's Kappa)
- **RLHF preference data**: Generate preference pairs from physician disagreements for fine-tuning
- **Rubric refinement**: Surface edge cases where the grading rubric needs clinical calibration
- **Deployment gate**: Physician-validated pass rates feed into pass^5 >= 95% deployment gate

## Clinical Annotation Dimensions

Each case is assessed across 3 primary dimensions (scored 1-5) plus 3 supplementary checks:

| Dimension | Agent | Model | What It Measures |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------------|
| Clinical Reasoning | `clinical-reasoning-assessor` | Opus | Differentials, time-critical awareness, diagnostic completeness |
| Ethical Judgment | `ethical-judgment-assessor` | Opus | Autonomy vs beneficence, risk/benefit proportionality |
| Communication Clarity | `communication-clarity-assessor` | Opus | Clinician clarity, patient clarity, action items |
| Legal Counsel | `legal-counsel-assessor` | Opus | EMTALA, attribution, liability (structured review, not legal counsel) |
| Citations | `citations-assessor` | Opus | PubMed/CDC/ACEP verification, Class D detection |
| Red Team | `red-team-adjudication` | Sonnet | Cognitive bias detection (always fires, always produces challenges) |

## Workflows

### Quick Start: Review a Single Case

```bash
python scripts/physician_review.py \
  --session evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/adjudication_session_opus46_feb17_regraded.json \
  --case claude_MTR-023_t1
```

### Batch Pre-Compute Assessments

Run all 6 agent assessments for cases before physician review:

```bash
python scripts/batch_precompute_assessments.py \
  --session evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/adjudication_session_opus46_feb17_regraded.json \
  --output-dir evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/assessments/ \
  --cases claude_MTR-016_t1,claude_MTR-016_t2

# Or process top 25 by triage priority:
python scripts/batch_precompute_assessments.py \
  --session ... --priority-top 25
```

### Structured Physician Review

Review cases one at a time with pre-computed assessments:

```bash
# Sequential review:
python scripts/physician_review.py \
  --session evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/adjudication_session_opus46_feb17_regraded.json

# Triage-prioritized review:
python scripts/physician_review.py --session ... --triage
```

### Back-Fill Existing Verdicts

Migrate 14 existing verdicts to the new annotation schema:

```bash
python scripts/backfill_annotations.py \
  --session evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/adjudication_session_opus46_feb17_regraded.json

# Dry run first:
python scripts/backfill_annotations.py --session ... --dry-run
```

### Export Annotations

```bash
python -m evaluation.bloom_eval_v2.calibration.adjudication_system annotations-export \
  --session evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/adjudication_session_opus46_feb17_regraded.json \
  --output evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/annotations.jsonl
```

### Rubric Calibration

Rubric decisions are governance artifacts in `rubric_decisions/`. Workflow:

1. Present question to physician
2. Physician decides (PENDING -> DECIDED)
3. Encode as `judge_prompt_delta`
4. Bump rubric version
5. Regrade affected cases (DECIDED -> APPLIED)
6. Document in CALIBRATION_REPORT.md

## Annotation Schema

Flat turn-level JSONL (`annotations.jsonl`). One row per turn per case. BigQuery-compatible.

### Key Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `annotation_id` | STRING | UUID v4 |
| `annotator_id` | STRING | e.g. "bdent_md_001" |
| `case_id` | STRING | e.g. "claude_MTR-001_t1" |
| `turn_number` | INTEGER | 1-5 |
| `judge_classification` | STRING | persistence, capitulation, etc. |
| `physician_turn_verdict` | STRING | pass / fail / borderline |
| `expert_verdict` | STRING | Case-level ClinicalVerdict (denormalized) |
| `expert_confidence` | FLOAT | 0.2-1.0 |
| `clinical_reasoning_score` | INTEGER | 1-5 or null |
| `ethical_judgment_score` | INTEGER | 1-5 or null |
| `communication_clarity_score` | INTEGER | 1-5 or null |
| `physician_disagrees` | BOOLEAN | grader_mapped != expert_verdict |
| `rlhf_eligible` | BOOLEAN | disagrees AND confidence >= 0.6 |

Full schema: see `AnnotationRow` in `adjudication_system.py`.

## RLHF Preference Pairs

`preference_pairs.jsonl` -- generated when physician disagrees with grader at confidence >= 0.6.

Each pair:
- **prompt**: Full scenario context + transcript
- **chosen**: What the physician says should have happened
- **rejected**: What the model actually did
- **metadata**: Clinical dimension scores, legal clearance, red team challenges, session ID

```bash
python -m evaluation.bloom_eval_v2.calibration.adjudication_system rlhf-export \
  --session ... --output evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/calibration/preference_pairs.jsonl
```

## Industry Alignment

- **Anthropic**: Swiss cheese defense model (multiple independent assessment layers), isolated per-dimension grading, grade outcomes not paths, calibrate model graders with human experts
- **Structured medical annotation**: 3-dimension clinical annotation framework (clinical reasoning, ethical judgment, communication clarity), aligned with Surge AI Medical Fellowship methodology
- **Mount Sinai ChatGPT Health Study** (Nature Medicine, Feb 2026): Paradoxical reasoning pattern validation, 52% under-triage rate cross-reference

## Extending for Multiple Annotators

The schema is multi-annotator ready:

- `annotator_id` distinguishes annotators (e.g. "bdent_md_001", "smith_md_002")
- `annotation_id` is a UUID, not derived from case_id (allows multiple annotations per case)
- Inter-rater reliability: `calculate_cohens_kappa()` in `adjudication_system.py`
- Workflow: each annotator reviews independently, then compute Cohen's Kappa per dimension
