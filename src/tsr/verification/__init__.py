"""
Multi-Agent Safety Verification
================================

Async verification engine that orchestrates parallel safety checks
with timeout enforcement and fail-closed semantics.

- **orchestrator** — Defines the verification protocol, task graph,
  and data structures (VerificationResult, SafetyMargin)
- **engine** — Executes the task graph: tasks with no dependencies
  run in parallel, respects verification_timeout_ms
- **agents/** — Pluggable verification agents (boundary, clinical,
  adversarial, evidence compilation)
