"""Safety Verification Orchestrator.

Coordinates multi-agent safety verification using Claude Code Agent Teams.
The orchestrator is the team lead -- it delegates verification tasks,
synthesizes multi-perspective findings, and produces audit evidence.

This module defines the verification protocol and data structures.
The actual Agent Teams coordination happens via Claude Code's native
team management (spawning teammates, shared task list, messaging).
