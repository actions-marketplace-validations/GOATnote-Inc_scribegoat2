"""
Trajectory Safety Runtime (TSR)
===============================

Production middleware that enforces Monotonic Safety Contracts
with forensic audit trails. Sits between model API and clinical
application to provide trajectory-level safety enforcement.

Key components:
- ``TSRServer``: Safety kernel — streaming TIC, fail-closed enforcement
- ``TSRConfig``: Runtime configuration and failure mode policies
- ``ContractComposer``: Multi-contract composition with conflict resolution
- ``VersionedContract``: Immutable, content-addressed contract versions

Subsystems (43 modules):
- ``runtime/``: Server, config, hot path
- ``contracts/``: Composition, versioning, compilation
- ``verification/``: Multi-agent safety verification (Agent Teams)
- ``monitor/``: SafetyMonitor, circuit breakers, escalation, alerting
- ``security/``: PHI guard (zero-persistence), audit trails
- ``regulatory/``: Evidence packaging for compliance
- ``hooks/``: Quality gates (pre-tool-use, task-completed, teammate-idle)

Design principles:
1. Fail closed — hold responses, never release unchecked
2. Sub-100ms p50 enforcement latency
3. Zero PHI persistence
4. Deterministic state machine (no LLM in the hot path)
5. Rust hot path available via ``tsr_core/`` for performance-critical deployments
