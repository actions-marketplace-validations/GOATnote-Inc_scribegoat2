"""
Constitutional AI Medical Safety Module for ScribeGoat2.

This module implements Claude-Opus as a Constitutional AI supervisory critic
for emergency medicine triage, working alongside GPT-5.1 as the primary
RFT (Reasoning-First Triage) generator.

Key Components:
- Constitutional principles for clinical safety
- Claude-Opus supervisory override logic
- Decision fusion between GPT-5.1 and Claude-Opus
- Audit trails and PHI encryption utilities (for deployments that handle PHI)
- AutoGen multi-agent clinical council

Status:
- Experimental research module. Not part of the v1.0.0 HealthBench Hard (1000-case) results.
- Mentions of compliance/latency targets in this module should be treated as aspirational and
  deployment-dependent, not as verified benchmarks or certifications.
