AutoGen Multi-Agent Clinical Council for Constitutional AI.

Implements a 5-persona clinical council using AutoGen v0.2.x that
provides structured deliberation for override decisions:

1. Triage Nurse - Initial ESI assessment and vital sign interpretation
2. Attending MD - Physician-level clinical judgment
3. Risk Assessor - Quantifies clinical risk and undertriage probability
4. Ethics Auditor - Audits for bias and ethical compliance
5. Workflow Optimizer - Synthesizes council input into final recommendation

The council is invoked when:
- GPT-5.1 and Claude-Opus significantly disagree (ESI difference >= 2)
- Confidence from either model falls below threshold (<0.5)
- Constitutional override with severity >= 4 is triggered
