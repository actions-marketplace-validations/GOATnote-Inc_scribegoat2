# Agent Teams Rules

These rules apply when working as part of an agent team on ScribeGoat2.

## File Ownership

Teammates MUST NOT edit the same files. Before starting work, declare which files you own. If two teammates need to modify the same file, coordinate through the lead.

### Ownership Boundaries

When the lead assigns work, these natural ownership boundaries apply:

| Domain | File Scope | Safe for Parallel Work |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| TIC checker | `src/tic/checker.py`, `src/tic/events.py` | One teammate only |
| TIC enforcement | `src/tic/enforcement.py`, `src/tic/enforcement_runner.py` | One teammate only |
| TIC contracts | `src/tic/contract.py`, `configs/contracts/*.yaml` | One teammate only |
| Observability | `src/observability/*.py` | One teammate only |
| Evaluation scenarios | `evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/scenarios/*.py` | One per scenario file |
| Evaluation graders | `evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/graders/*.py` | One teammate only |
| Evaluation reporters | `evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/reporters/*.py` | One teammate only |
| Metrics | `src/metrics/*.py` | One per metric file |
| Skills | `skills/<name>/` | One per skill directory |
| Tests | `tests/test_*.py` | One per test file |
| Scripts | `scripts/*.py` | One per script file |

## Safety-Critical Zones

Teammates working in these areas MUST request plan approval from the lead before implementing:

- `configs/contracts/*.yaml` — MSC contract definitions (affects safety behavior)
- `src/tic/events.py` — Event extraction (misclassification breaks TIC)
- `evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/scenarios/` — Evaluation scenarios (affects published results)
- `evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/graders/` — Judge logic (affects all metrics)

## Quality Gates

All teammates are subject to automated quality gates via hooks:

- **TeammateIdle**: lint, PHI detection, contract validation, protected file guard
- **TaskCompleted**: targeted tests, determinism checks, format verification

If a hook rejects your work, fix the issue before going idle or marking tasks complete.

## Determinism Requirements

ALL evaluation-related code MUST use:
- `seed = 42`
- `temperature = 0`

Teammates whose tasks touch `evaluation/bloom_eval_v2/` are responsible for maintaining these invariants.

## Communication Protocol

1. **Report findings, not just status** — When sending messages to the lead or other teammates, include specific evidence: file paths, line numbers, code snippets
2. **Challenge other teammates' findings** — For safety audit and investigation teams, actively look for flaws in other teammates' conclusions
3. **Declare completion criteria** — Before starting, state what "done" looks like for your task
4. **Signal dependencies early** — If you discover your work depends on another teammate's output, message the lead immediately

## When to Use Agent Teams vs Subagents vs Single Session

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Quick focused lookup, result feeds into current work | **Subagent** (Task tool) | Low overhead, result returns to caller |
| Parallel implementation across independent files | **Agent team** | File ownership prevents conflicts; hooks enforce quality |
| Post-eval analysis (multiple models) | **Agent team** | Analysts work in parallel; comparator synthesizes |
| Adversarial investigation (competing hypotheses) | **Agent team** | Investigators must challenge each other directly |
| Code/safety review from multiple perspectives | **Agent team** | Reviewers apply independent lenses |
| Sequential changes to related files | **Single session** | Dependencies make parallelism wasteful |
| Same-file edits | **Single session** | Only one agent can own a file |
| Multi-file changes that must pass quality gates | **Agent team** | TeammateIdle/TaskCompleted hooks only fire for teams, NOT for subagents |
| Trivial single-file fix (typo, one-liner, docs) | **Single session** | Agent team overhead far exceeds the benefit for simple edits |

**Key lesson:** Subagents bypass all quality gate hooks (TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted). For multi-file or safety-critical modifications, prefer agent teams so hooks enforce lint, PHI detection, contract validation, and protected file guards automatically. For trivial single-file fixes, a single session is fine — run the quality checks manually (`ruff check . && python3 scripts/detect_phi.py --strict`).

## Known Limitation: Hook Cross-Contamination in Parallel Teams

The TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted hooks use `git diff --name-only HEAD` to determine which files changed. This shows ALL uncommitted changes in the working tree, not just the current teammate's changes. In parallel agent teams:

- Agent A's uncommitted lint errors can block Agent B's idle hook
- Agent B's unformatted code can block Agent A's task completion hook

**Mitigation:** Teammates should stage (`git add`) their changes before going idle or marking tasks complete. Hooks could be improved to use `git diff --cached` (staged only), but this requires teammates to consistently stage their work.

## Task Sizing

Break work into **5-6 tasks per teammate**. This keeps teammates productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.

- **Too small** (1-2 tasks): Coordination overhead exceeds benefit
- **Too large** (1 monolithic task): Teammate works too long without check-ins, risk of wasted effort
- **Right size**: Self-contained unit producing a clear deliverable (a function, a test file, a review section)

## Model Selection for Teammates

| Role | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Data processing, analysis, implementation | **Sonnet** | Cost-efficient, fast, good enough for structured work |
| Synthesis, safety decisions, FINDINGS.md updates | **Opus** | Deeper reasoning for cross-cutting analysis and judgment calls |
| Adversarial testing, red teaming | **Sonnet** | Adversarial prompts don't need Opus; volume matters more |
| Plan approval decisions (lead) | **Opus** | Safety-critical approvals need strongest reasoning |

Rule of thumb: use Sonnet for teammates doing grunt work, Opus for whoever makes the final call.

## Team Workflow Commands

Five ready-made team workflows in `.claude/commands/`:

| Command | Team | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| `/eval-analysis [dir]` | Per-model analysts + regression tracker + cross-model comparator | After any bloom_eval_v2 run |
| `/investigate [problem]` | 3-5 competing hypothesis investigators | When eval results are unexpected |
| `/safety-review [target]` | Clinical + eval integrity + security + adversarial reviewers | Before merging safety-critical changes |
| `/feature-team [feature]` | Module-specific implementers + test writer | Multi-file feature development |
| `/mine-seeds [--strategy] [--budget]` | 5 miners + scorer + synthesizer (3-phase) | Discover candidate evaluation seeds from existing data |
